            <h2>Meet Melanie</h2>
            <p>For over 20 years, I have worked as a qualified Integrative Counsellor, Psychotherapist and Supervisor. I’ve lectured in counselling, written and delivered training and facilitated various groups. I work with children, young adults, adults and elders. I am a Registered Member of the British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists and of Ecopsychology UK.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I aim to provide a warm, compassionate, safe and confidential space to find the most helpful approach to working with you. Through personal experience and my years of professional interactions.  I know and value the support that counselling and psychotherapy can give us and I am more than happy to discuss just how I am able to help you when we first chat.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I am a great believer in utilising nature to help maintain our mental and physical well-being and like to bring aspects of this and creativity into my therapeutic work when appropriate.

        <p>Melanie is an exceptionally skilful, kind and compassionate counsellor. She provided me with a calm and inviting relationship to discuss my thoughts and feelings; her genuine empathy saturated our interactions and I always felt comfortable in her presence. Her ability to convey unconditional positive regard was impressive and I never felt I had to be someone I wasn’t. I will always treasure the space, relationship and psychological support Melanie provided me. Without her support I am a confident a less healthy and more self-destructive trajectory would have ensued.  <br>Mel comes with my full recommendation.</p>
