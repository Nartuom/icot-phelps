                <p>Melanie was a lifeline to me as a child, I believe my meetings with her are the reason I'm able to successfully convey my emotions as an adult. Melanie led me to understand why I felt certain ways and she let me express those feelings without judgment, just complete compassion and understanding. I am extremely grateful that Melanie was a part of my life, she was there for me at a time when I felt like I had no one else. Thank you for spending your time with me, for believing in me and for allowing me to express myself!

                <p>When we found out we were pregnant it was exciting and we were very happy but then I realised in 7-8 months I would have to go through labour!! I was so scared I didn't sleep and was constantly worried about it but after my first session of hypnobirthing it was like a weight was lifted!! It really helped me understand what my body would do during labour and that it was made to give birth. After the course finished I was excited to go through labour and experience what my body could naturally do. The relaxations were brilliant, they take a bit of getting used to but once you really relax into it it's lovely and helpful. The course really help eased my husband's worries also and he could see a huge change in me, I was so excited and relaxed not worried! We both loved all the science and information on how the female body was made to give birth. Although my labour really did not go the way we really wanted I was able to use the information to calm and reassure me when we got induced and being able to phone Melanie at each stage for reassurance really helped me. When it came to active labour we used the visualisations and the breathing we were taught and although labour wasn't an easy ride I really believe that hypnobirthing helped me through everything and I gave birth to a calm, happy, and contented baby girl. I believe that hypnobirthing allowed me to be calm and relaxed during my pregnancy and this is why my baby was born like that.
